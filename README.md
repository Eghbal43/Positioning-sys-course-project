This project demonstrates the implementation of a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) in MATLAB for offline attitude estimation of smart devices using sensor data (gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers). The work integrates concepts from control theory and aerospace engineering, leveraging data from the phyphox app to visualize and compare the performance of MEKF with simpler dead-reckoning methods. Key features include quaternion-based orientation estimation, sensor calibration, and dynamic 3D visualizations.
